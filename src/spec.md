# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the homepage hero/background image upload control easy to find and use from the Admin Dashboard “Home Page” tab.

**Planned changes:**
- Surface the existing `HomepageVisualsForm` within the Admin Dashboard → “Home Page” tab in a clearly visible hero/background visuals section (not only under “Appearance”).
- Ensure the “Home Page” tab supports uploading a hero background image, saving, and showing the saved image state after refresh (from settings data).
- Ensure the “Home Page” tab supports removing the uploaded hero background image, saving, and indicating that the default background will be restored.
- Keep existing “Home Page” tab content editing intact and keep all hero visuals controls (overlay color, overlay opacity, fallback gradient) usable, with clear English helper text explaining upload/replace and remove/restore behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** Admins can upload, save, view (after refresh), or remove the homepage hero background image directly from the Admin Dashboard “Home Page” tab without losing any existing homepage text editing or hero visual controls.
