  "summary": "The BuildRequest (REQ-31) requires surfacing the existing `HomepageVisualsForm` (hero/background upload + related controls) within the Admin Dashboard “Home Page” tab. In the provided diff summary, `AdminDashboardPage.tsx` shows updates to the “Home Page” tab header/content editor and a `Separator`, but the truncated snippet does not provide evidence that `HomepageVisualsForm` is actually rendered in the “home” tab content. No other modified file shows the UI placement either (the other changes are documentation/state summaries).",
