        "An admin can remove the uploaded hero background image from the “Home Page” tab and save successfully, and the UI indicates the default background will be restored.",
        "No functionality is removed: existing homepage content editing (text) remains available in the “Home Page” tab, and the hero visuals controls (overlay color, overlay opacity, fallback gradient) remain usable.",
        "All user-facing helper text in the surfaced form remains in English and clearly explains: uploading replaces the default background; removing restores the default after saving."
